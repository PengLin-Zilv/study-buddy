## 🎯 The Problem

Students make study plans but never stick to them. Current AI tools give advice but provide no accountability or follow-through.

- **Personalized Dashboard**: See your exam countdown and study plan
- **Progress Tracking**: Daily check-ins and streak counters (coming soon)
- **AI Study Plans**: Adaptive learning that adjusts to your pace (coming soon)

## ✨ What's Working Now

- ✅ 4-step onboarding flow
- ✅ Personalized dashboard with countdown
- ✅ Timezone-safe date handling
