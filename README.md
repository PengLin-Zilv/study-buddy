> You AI Study Partner That Actually Sticks

## What is Study Buddy?

Studdy Buddy is an AI-powered study companion that holds you accountable through personalized learning sessions. Unlike one-off AI chatbots, Study Buddy remembers your progess, adapts to your learning pace, and ensures you actually follow through on your study plans.
